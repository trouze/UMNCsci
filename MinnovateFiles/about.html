            <h2>How Minnovate Works</h2>
          </div>
          <p>Each semester, our group puts on the following events:</p>
            <li>Networking Event: Happens during week 10 of the semester, industry professionals attend the event to connect with students in a relaxed atmosphere, keeping students up to date with industry trends.
            <li>Resume Workshop: One of Minnovate's goals is to get its students a step closer to their dream career, so our Officers (and even industry pros) will hold this event to help you get that interview.
            <li>Innovation Challenge: We want to promote a culture of innovators and entrepreneurs at the U. Through real-world prompts, participants will create a prototype that can help solve real problems facing society today.
            <li>Prototype Presentation: The culmination of all your hard work throughout the semester, you get the chance to present your prototype in front of industry pros and potentially secure funding to further your idea!

            <p>Touched on in the presentation, the Industry Readiness Program is one of the best parts about being in Minnovate</p>
          </div>
          <p>The Minnovate Industry Readiness Program seeks to equip students with the skills most important and common to engineering fields, recognizing the importance of both technical and non-technical.  Here's how it works:</p>
            <li>Held over the course of the spring semester.
            <li>Groups meet once a week for 2 hours in the Anderson Student Innovation Lab.
            <li>Students are grouped into teams and have the entire semester to design a prototype.
            <li>Students receive certification from Anderson Labs on their transcripts.
            <li>Students build technical, teamwork, and communication skills in a hands-on project
            <li>Program culminates with a final presentation in front of head of Design at Anderson Labs and other program members!
