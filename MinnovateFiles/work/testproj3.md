Living in area where temperature reaches extremes or areas without significant yard space prevents people being able to sustain their own gardens. Team Blue set out to build a garden box made of laser cut acrylic, 3D printed stands for UV lights, and basic circuit design via Arduino that could sense moisture and output information via LED readout.

This project served as a prototype to help gardeners determine if their plant needed more water or not, especially those in climates difficult to grow plants, this sensor would increase the likelihood that a healthy crop could grow.
