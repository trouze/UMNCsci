During Spring 2019, Team Orange set out to develop a watch that could sense movements of elderly people and remind them to take their pills.

The need was: “Trauma is the fifth leading cause of death in persons more than 65 years of age, 3 and falls are responsible for 70 percent of accidental deaths in persons 75 years of age and older”.

With the use of an Arduino and 3D printing, the team developed a wearable watch that could alert 911 in the event of a sensed fall or sudden movement. With real world application, the team developed a project charter, built an Arduino with sensors, and attached a wrist strap to make it a wearable device. Below is a mock drawing of their idea.
