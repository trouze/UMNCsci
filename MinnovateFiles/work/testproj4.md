Team Green set out to develop a reusable box for meal kit companies. It was their belief that the meal kit and food industries waste a lot of Earth's resources on packaging of their products, so why not develop something that can be used again and again?

The team worked to build a 3D printed modular box that came equipped with areas for ice packs as well a sensor that could measure the temperature in the enclosure.
